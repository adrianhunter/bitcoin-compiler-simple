# bitcoin-compiler-simple

A minimal Example how you could build a simple and naive Rescript to bitcoin script compiler.

Currently it only converts constants and Identities, so lot's of code is missing to make it easier to read/learn


## Getting started

from root folder run

`npm install`
`npm start`


to build-watch the project


## testing stuff

change the js-post-build cmd path in test/bsconfig.json to point to your correct _esy. So _esy/default/store/b/bitcoin-xxxxxxx and replace xxxxxxx with the correct folder name

go to test folder and

`npm install`
`npm start`

To compile the test rescript files
